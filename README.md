# Kotlin
---

Java interoperability was one of the cornerstones of Kotlin. Interoperability is very important for introducing Kotlin gradually to an existing Java codebase. Even when writing a new project from scratch, one has to fit the language into the bigger picture of the platform with all of its libraries written in Java.

The idea of Kotlin was concieved at Jetbrains in 2010. We needed full compatibility with the existing Java code. Kotlin 1.0 came out 5 years after the first commit to the repository.

Kotlin is named after an island near St. Petersburg, Russia, where most of the Kotlin development team is located. In using an island name, we followed the precedent estabilished by Java and Ceylon, but we decided to go for something closer to our homes.
